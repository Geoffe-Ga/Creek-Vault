# Systems thinking and integration patterns

This fragment explores how systems thinking helps us integrate
complex patterns across multiple domains. The goal is to find
connections between different frequencies of understanding.

When we approach knowledge as a living system rather than a static
archive, we begin to see emerging threads and eddies that connect
disparate ideas into coherent wholes.
