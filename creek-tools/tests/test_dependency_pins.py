"""Guard tests for security-motivated dependency pins.

Each pin here answers specific CVEs; the tests guard both the declared
floor and the resolved lock so a future relock cannot regress onto a
vulnerable release.

``mcp`` (issue #862): mcp 1.27.1 carries CVE-2026-52869 —
cross-principal session injection on the Streamable HTTP bearer-token
transport. That transport is reachable here: ``creek_mcp`` runs
streamable-http with a ``TokenVerifier``. The same release also carries
CVE-2026-52870 and CVE-2026-59950. All three are fixed in mcp 1.28.1.
mcp is a direct dependency, so its floor lives in
``[project].dependencies`` (with the ``<2.0.0`` ceiling intact).

``pyasn1`` (issue #867): pyasn1 0.6.3 carries CVE-2026-59885
(quadratic-time OID-arc decoding — a DoS on hostile BER/DER input) and
CVE-2026-59886 (unbounded big-int construction from REAL exponents —
also a DoS). Both are fixed in pyasn1 0.6.4. pyasn1 is transitive-only:
it enters this graph via the ``gdrive`` extra → google-auth →
pyasn1-modules and is never imported directly, so its floor lives in
``[tool.uv].constraint-dependencies`` rather than
``[project].dependencies`` — a uv constraint tightens resolution when
the package is already in the graph without declaring a dependency we
never import (precedent: the pyjwt>=2.13.0 constraint, DEP-003).

Two independent guards per package:

* **pyproject floor** — the declared specifier must reject the last
  vulnerable release so a future ``uv lock`` relock cannot resolve
  back down to it.
* **locked version** — ``uv.lock`` is what CI installs and what
  pip-audit actually inspects, so the resolved entry must already be
  at or above the patched version.
