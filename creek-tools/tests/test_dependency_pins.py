"""Guard tests for the ``mcp`` dependency pin (issue #862).

mcp 1.27.1 carries CVE-2026-52869 — cross-principal session injection on
the Streamable HTTP bearer-token transport. That transport is reachable
here: ``creek_mcp`` runs streamable-http with a ``TokenVerifier``. The
same release also carries CVE-2026-52870 and CVE-2026-59950. All three
are fixed in mcp 1.28.1.

Two independent guards:

* **pyproject floor** — the ``mcp`` specifier in ``[project].dependencies``
  must reject anything below 1.28.1 so a future ``uv lock`` relock cannot
  resolve back down to a vulnerable release, while keeping the ``<2.0.0``
  ceiling intact.
* **locked version** — ``uv.lock`` is what CI installs and what pip-audit
  actually inspects, so the resolved ``mcp`` entry must already be at or
  above the patched version.
